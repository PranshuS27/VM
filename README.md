# VM

Pretty bare bones virtual machine for LC-3. 

It has basically everything you need to run simple programs in it. 

Based off https://www.jmeiners.com/lc3-vm/ although I ended up writing a lot of it by myself and only consulting it as a reference. I tried to make everything kind of match it because it seemed organized. 

# TO DO 
Not really sure honestly, but I do want to try to make a VM for an x86 CPU at some point
